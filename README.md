# Project Definition

For this project, we need to load the Melbourne Housing dataset into our project. The quality and amount of data we collect will determine how good our predictive model can be. For this reason, we need to examine the dataset very carefully. We will estimate the price of a house using the Melbourne Housing dataset, which is a real-life example. Before evaluating any cost, we will start by analyzing the data using preprocessing techniques. We will then build our models and measure their performance to complete the project.

# Information about the data

Melbourne is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. The dataset contains several attributes of the houses in Melbourne along with their prices.
